*Sky’s Sea* A minimal, eye‑friendly syntax theme inspired by the colors of the sky colors throughout the day but withot sun effects, It's a collection of 12 carefully crafted color themes for the **Zed** editor. Each flavor is named after a period of the day (Arabic prayer times) and mirrors the sky’s natural palette at that moment. The themes are deliberately **minimalistic** and **easy on the eyes**, helping you stay focused on code during long editing sessions.

## 🎨 Overview  

Sky’s Sea is a collection of **12 theme flavors** that translate the natural hues of the sky—from dawn to night—into a clean, minimalist code‑editing 
experience. Each flavor is carefully tuned to reduce eye strain during long coding sessions while keeping the focus on the code itself.

**Design goals**  
**Minimalistic look** – only essential UI elements are highlighted.  
**Eye‑comfort** – soft contrast and soothing gradients.  
**Border‑optional** – flavors with a trailing `+` include subtle, clear borders around UI components (panels, sidebars, etc.). Flavors without `+` 
keep a border‑less look for a truly seamless feel.  
**Easy customization** – all colors are exposed as CSS/VS Code token variables, making tweaks trivial.
